# Carbon Footprint Predictor

**Carbon Footprint Predictor** is a web application that estimates the embodied carbon emissions (COâ‚‚e) of building construction projects based on key design parameters. This tool helps architects, engineers, and sustainability professionals assess and minimize the environmental impact of their projects using machine learning.
